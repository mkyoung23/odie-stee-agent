1. Open the Firebase Console and ensure the "lifelapse-27e17" project is fully set up with Firestore, Storage, Authentication (Email, Google, Apple), and Remote Config.
2. Use Gemini chat/API to:
    - Generate and verify all Firestore and Storage security rules for production.
    - Generate schema and default documents for Users, Groups, Videos collections.
    - Generate all needed backend logic and AI features (e.g., Gemini-powered captions, video processing).
3. Enable Vertex AI and integrate Gemini as the AI backend for text/video/image features, as described in the blueprint.
4. In FlutterFlow (or your chosen frontend builder):
    - Ensure all UI screens are built: onboarding, auth, home, video list/player, groups, favorites, capsule seal, profile/settings, notifications.
    - Integrate Gemini/Vertex AI features (e.g., AI captions) into the video flow, using Remote Config for prompts and model versions.
5. Use Gemini API to generate and auto-paste production-ready code for:
    - Flutter/Dart logic (all platforms: iOS, Android, Web)
    - In-app Remote Config fetch and AI calls
    - Any missing business logic or UI code
6. Build the app for iOS and Android:
    - Run `flutter build apk` and `flutter build ios`
    - Use Xcode and Android Studio to archive and export release builds.
7. Distribute:
    - For iOS: Prepare a TestFlight beta and provide the invite link.
    - For Android: Upload to Google Play Internal Testing or generate a direct APK link for download.
    - For Web: Deploy to Firebase Hosting and generate a shareable link.
8. Test:
    - Run basic automated and manual tests on all platforms.
    - Report any issues to Gemini for code fixes, retry the build/test.
9. Save all generated code, configs, rules, and documentation to "firebase_setup_notes.txt".
10. Commit and push all changes to GitHub for backup.
11. If any step fails, use Gemini chat or API to debug, then retry the failed step.
12. Alert me when the builds are complete and provide links/instructions to download and install on my devices and share with friends.
